# C++ Funcbeat Player for Windows

This is a program that plays Funcbeat (not Floatbeat) in Windows.
There are some programs that can play Bytebeats, but I couldn't find the way to play Funcbeat, so I made this program based on Bytebeat player.
It's not perfect, however it can play Funcbeat for at least 1 minute.
You may be able to extend duration by properly using looping function.

This code requires winmm.lib to build. Since I struggled a lot to use library on MinGW, I recommend using Visual Studio to build this code.

Please set volume to lower level before running this program.
